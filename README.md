# Week2-CSS

## Description 

This is a webpage that will serve as a portfolio for the assignments and projects I do for the bootcamp.  The design, layout, and content of this page will continue to gorw as the bootcamp progresses. This project will be very helpful when applying to jobs and showing people what I have learned and what I can do.

## Usage
The usage of this application is to serve as a webpage for peers and employers to view the code I've worked on
